            I like playing games since i was a kid, and i always wanted to make my own game.
            I also like this sloppy AI brainrot meme and that's the only two reason why i made this game.
            <br>
            It actually has a leaderboard like system that is stored within my local database but it's not always available bcs i'm too broke to actually afford a proper server 
            <br>
